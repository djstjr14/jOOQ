the classes in this package were not applied to strategy pattern
this classes checks about annotation. if there are no annotations, it will return error msg.

but the error msg and the ways of checking errors can be changed later.
it violates OCP.

So, I made interface to check the kinds of annotation error and divided class then
made them inherit relations. this pattern is called strategy patterns.
